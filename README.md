Coretapper

_In memoriam cockatrice.de, mtgimage.com, and many other projects killed by WotC_

DISCLAIMER
---

Coretapper is merely a study in PureScript, please don't deploy it anywhere.

If you deploy it somewhere, please don't tell us about your deployment, so
that when WotC goes turns on community favourite
C&D-[blackmail](http://magiccards.info/scans/en/on/127.jpg)-shit-fan,
all of us can honestly tell them that we shut our deployment down and don't
know of any other deployments of this code.

â€¦

Not like we're going to deploy this code anywhere anyway. Remember, it's
just a study in PureScript.

ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY
---

This repository defines [a format](https://github.com/magic-tools/coretapper/blob/master/docs/MTG/Cards.md#card)
of representing cards and sets, also provide [means](https://github.com/magic-tools/coretapper/blob/master/docs/MTG/Pools.md)
to generate card pools. All that you need to start writing the logic of a certain Magic tool, without worrying about
the data representation and fetching it. Together with running `getJson.sh` from `farseek`, it should get you
up and running on your way to writing a groundbreakingly cool tool for Magic the Gathering world in minutes.

[Example of using it](https://github.com/magic-tools/coretapper/blob/master/src/Main.purs).

Tests? Hm. Nope. Also, all the algorithms are `O(so_slow)`. Pull requests are welcome, especially on the `Data/` side of things.
If we implement functions exported by modules there properly, odds are, stuff is going to get merged into PureScript libs.
